# FedPR
With the continuous development of deep learning
in the field of image generation models, a large number of vivid
forged faces have been generated and spread on the Internet.
These high-authenticity artifacts could grow into a threat to
society security. Existing face forgery detection methods directly
utilize the obtained public shared or centralized data for training
but ignore the personal privacy and security issues when personal
data couldnâ€™t be centralizedly shared in real-world scenarios.
Additionally, different distributions caused by diverse artifact
types would further bring adverse influences on the forgery
detection task. To solve the mentioned problems, the paper
proposes a novel generalized residual Federated learning for
face Forgery detection (FedForgery). The designed variational
autoencoder aims to learn robust discriminative residual feature
maps to detect forgery faces (with diverse or even unknown
artifact types). Furthermore, the general federated learning
strategy is introduced to construct distributed detection model
trained collaboratively with multiple local decentralized devices,
which could further boost the representation generalization.
Experiments conducted on publicly available face forgery de-
tection datasets prove the superior performance of the proposed
FedForgery.
